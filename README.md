# Minecraft Server Malware

This plugin made for 1.21 Paper Servers causes destruction and a semi backdoor.


## Functions
- Counts every restart the server makes and logs it in a text file.
- Every restart it ops and unbans a specified player from the server, basically backdooring the server completely.
- At a specified restart count (default=10) the plugin delets all server files and worlds but keeps itself and resets the counter.
- Easy to use, settings for the plugin are at the top of the client.java class.
